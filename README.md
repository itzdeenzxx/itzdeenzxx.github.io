### üîë Key Concepts: **Clearing**

| **Source**       | **Definition**                                                                                                                                                            |

| **CISSP Glossary (Student Guide)** | The removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software recovery utilities. |
| **ChatGPT**      | The removal of sensitive data from storage devices in a way that ensures the data cannot be reconstructed using normal system functions or standard data recovery software. |
| **Gemini**       | The removal of sensitive data from storage devices in such a way that there is assurance that the data may not be reconstructed using normal system functions or software recovery utilities. |
| **NIST**         | Clearing refers to the process of removing data from a storage device in such a way that the data can no longer be recovered by normal system functions or basic data recovery techniques, but the device is still usable. Clearing typically involves overwriting the data with non-sensitive information to ensure that the original data is not easily retrievable. |
| **ChatGPT**      | Clearing is the process of removing data from a storage device so that it cannot be recovered, while keeping the device usable. This is done by overwriting the data with non-sensitive information. |
| **Gemini**       | Clearing is a process that removes data from a storage device in a way that makes it unrecoverable by standard methods. However, the device remains functional. This is typically done by overwriting the data with non-sensitive information to prevent data recovery. |
