    <h2>‚úçÔ∏è Self-Interpretation</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Clearing</strong> is the process of securely removing data from storage devices to ensure it cannot be recovered while keeping the device functional. This process is critical for protecting sensitive data and preventing unauthorized use of the data after the device is sold or discarded.
    </p>

    <h2>üéØ Key Understandings</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Complete Data Removal</strong>: Ensures sensitive data is irrecoverable and prevents misuse of deleted data.</li>
      <li><strong>Preserves Device Functionality</strong>: Keeps the device usable for resale or reuse.</li>
      <li><strong>Overwriting Techniques</strong>: Overwrites data with random or non-sensitive information.</li>
    </ul>
